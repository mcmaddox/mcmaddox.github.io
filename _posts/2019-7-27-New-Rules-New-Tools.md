## Here's the truth: The music business has changed.

The internet, digital distribution, social media, and streaming have changed the dynamics of the industry. Now, the barriers to creating music and connecting with fans have been lowered. Artists have more control over their own distribution and marketing, and an independent career is just as possible (and in some cases more profitable) as a traditional label deal.

**one2one2** is a platform designed to help artists connect to people looking for musical talent. We believe artists should spend less time on marketing and promotion and more time on music and performing. We believe independent artists and working musicians need tools to help them simplify the process of finding, negotiating, and securing shows at venues&mdash;around the corner or around the country. 

Our philosophy is echoed in our tagline: 

## "Less Work. More Play."

_Less Work_ means artists can: 
* Find shows without the hassle of going door to door
* Use demos posted to leading social media platforms to market themselves to potential sponsors
* Negotiate with sponsors and easily keep track of upcoming or completed performances

_More Play_ means artists can: 
* Spend more time perfecting their craft through live performances
* Develop relationships with local venues, studio engineers, music producers, show promoters, and event planners   
* Connect with audiences and create new fans
